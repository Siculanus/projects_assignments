<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> <FONT SIZE=4>	The first
one is the product made by &ldquo;monkeylearn.com&rdquo;. The page
seems to select only the words it considers to be more important,
leaving out the rest of the text. I found the activity in both to be
quite limited and uninteresting, but this one was by far more
limited, even though the result actually has a better visual. You can
change the size of the font, the order and shape of the letters, the
colors both from the words and background</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
latter is the product done by &ldquo;wordclouds.com&rdquo;.  The
quote appears in its fullness and there is a gigantic variety of
shapes that can be used to order the words. I have failed however to
find one which would make the quote actually readable.  For this
reason, I have found the tools to be unable to produce my expected
results.  Images can be downloaded as images or as a csv file,
showing up as a table that tells us how many times words are used.</FONT></FONT></P>
